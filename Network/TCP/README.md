# Notes

**Compiled on**
- *Intel Pentium*  

**Toolchain vendor**
- *GNU GCC 5.1.0 TDM (MingW)*  
- *Compiler and linker flags can be found in "compile.bat"*   

**SFML Version**

# Current Goals

- [x] Start development on a simple, extendable TCP Server and Client using the SFML Network library - Project started
- [x] Develop a starting foundation for connection, authentication and data transmission - Needs testing 
- [ ] Have the TCP service running on an internal separate thread (0/100%)
- [ ] Make some sort of homebrew authentication (25/100%) - Simple GUUID assignment, unencrypted, needs work
- [ ] Solidify the internal mechanism, make it private and develop an interface for extended objects to use (0/100%)


# What this is

This is an attempt at making a useful network library for educational and personal use. Code in here will collect as I learn new perspective, systems and ideas.
