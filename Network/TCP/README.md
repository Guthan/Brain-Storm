- [ ] Have the TCP service running on an internal separate thread (0/100%)
- [ ] Make some sort of homebrew authentication (25/100%) - Simple GUUID assignment, unencrypted, needs work
- [ ] Solidify the internal mechanism, make it private and develop an interface for extended objects to use (0/100%)
